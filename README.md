	This project is meant to implement an HTTP API for a bike-sharing business
	and should return results in JSON format.

	This is a technical assignment which I am completing
	as per AWS's instructions, before my on-site interview.

	Usage of API:

	server/
	info about API

	server/stations_and_bikes
	returns the number of operational stations and ebikes + bikes

	server/distance?origin=latitude, longtitude
	returns the distance (aerial) of the nearest station as well as the station itself
